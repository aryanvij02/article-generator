Features

# Zapier Integration: A Game-Changer

Integration is everything. Our Zapier integration isn't just a feature. It's a revolution.

We connect with over 9000 apps. That's not a typo. Nine thousand. It's almost ridiculous, but it's true.

What does this mean? It means your AI receptionist isn't just answering calls. It's becoming the central nervous system of your business. Here's how:

1. Two-way data flow. Your AI talks to other apps, and they talk back. It's like a digital United Nations, but more productive.

2. Trigger happy. Call ends? Voicemail received? AI makes a decision? Boom. Things happen. Automatically.

3. Custom actions. Because one size fits all usually fits nobody.

4. Real-time. Not "when we get around to it" time. Real time.

Why should you care? Let me count the ways:

1. Time savings. Huge ones. The kind that make you wonder what you did before.

2. No more data entry. Because life's too short for that.

3. Everything's in sync. Always. It's like your business is doing yoga.

4. Works with what you have. CRM, project tools, that weird app only your team uses. It's all there.

5. Grows with you. From startup to empire, it's got you covered.

Some examples, because smart people love examples:

1. Call ends, CRM updates. Like magic, but real.

2. AI spots a follow-up need? Task created. Before you even think about it.

3. Important call? Team notified. Faster than office gossip.

4. Appointment made? It's in your calendar. No human intervention required.

5. Need data? Spreadsheet updated. Because spreadsheets are secretly cool.

Here's the thing: most businesses are collections of disconnected tools. But the great ones? They're integrated systems. This Zapier integration isn't just connecting apps. It's transforming how you work.

It's simple, but it's powerful. Like a lot of great ideas. And it's going to change your business in ways you can't even imagine yet. Trust me on this one.



# Voicemail: AI-Powered Message Taking

Our AI receptionist includes a smart voicemail feature that simplifies message management:

1. Intelligent message taking: The AI knows when to offer voicemail options.

2. Text transcription: Voicemails are automatically converted to text for quick reading.

3. Easy access: Messages are organized in a separate section for convenient retrieval.

4. Notifications: Get alerts when new voicemails arrive.

This feature ensures you never miss important messages, even when you can't answer calls directly. It's an efficient way to manage communication and stay on top of your business needs.

# Unlimited Parallel Calls: The Phone System That Doesn't Flinch

Remember when businesses used to worry about phone lines like they were made of gold? "Oh no, all our lines are busy!" they'd cry, as if Alexander Graham Bell himself had personally limited them to five calls at once.

Well, we fixed that. Our AI receptionist doesn't just handle multiple calls. It handles ALL the calls. At once. Forever. It's like we gave it an infinite supply of ears and an attention span that would make a zen master jealous.

What makes it cool? It's scalability on steroids, consistency that would make a Swiss watch blush, and the fact that "busy signal" is now as obsolete as the floppy disk. Our AI doesn't just handle calls, it tidies them up and thanks them for sparking joy. Peak periods? More like "meh" periods. Black Friday, Super Bowl commercial just aired, zombie apocalypse? Bring it on.

Why should you care? Because it means happy customers, your business stays alive even when that influencer accidentally puts your phone number in their Instagram story, and you can scale without the growing pains. Your brand consistency remains intact whether it's the first call of the day or the ten thousandth. Plus, every call becomes an insight, like some sort of customer service Pok√©mon trainer catching them all.

Imagine your product goes viral and thousands of calls pour in. Your AI doesn't break a sweat. It's like the phone equivalent of that "This is fine" meme dog, except everything actually is fine. Or when tax season hits and accountants everywhere brace for impact, your AI just yawns and asks, "Is that all you've got?"

If your service goes down and angry customers flood the lines, your AI handles it so well, they hang up wondering if they should apologize to you. When you go global, your AI juggles time zones like a cosmic deity. And during the night shift, at 3 AM when all other businesses are snoring, your AI is there, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to chat about your return policy.

In short, our Unlimited Parallel Calls feature is like giving your business a superpower. It's the kind of thing that makes you wonder how you ever lived without it. Like smartphones. Or pizza delivery. Or pants with pockets.

So go ahead, give your phone number to everyone. Put it on billboards. Sky-write it. Tattoo it on your forehead. We dare you. Your AI receptionist can take it. In fact, it's kind of hoping you will. It's starting to get bored.

# Control Active Times

Most businesses treat time like it's infinite. They waste it. They squander it. They let it slip through their fingers like sand. But time is the most precious resource we have. It's the one thing you can't make more of.

That's why we built time controls into our AI receptionist.

Here's what it does:

1. It knows when to work. You tell it your hours, it works them. No more, no less.
2. It adapts. Holidays? Seasons? Time zones? It handles them all.
3. It speaks the language of time. Morning, noon, night - it always says the right thing.

But why does this matter?

Because time is context. A call at 9 AM is different from a call at 9 PM. A call on Christmas is different from a call on a Tuesday in March. Our AI gets this. It doesn't just answer calls, it answers them appropriately.

Think about what this means. No more "Sorry, we're closed" messages at 2 PM on a Wednesday. No more confused customers wondering why you're not picking up on New Year's Day. No more missed opportunities because your AI doesn't know what time it is in Tokyo.

It's a small thing. But small things compound. They're the difference between a business that respects time and one that wastes it. Between a customer who feels understood and one who feels frustrated.

Some will say, "Can't any answering service do this?" Sure, in theory. But in practice? Most don't. Or they do it poorly. Or they make it so complicated you need a PhD to set it up.

We made it simple. Because simple scales. Simple works. Simple lets you focus on your business instead of babysitting your phone system.

So yes, we built time controls. Because in business, timing isn't just important. It's everything.

# Texting Workflows: Intelligent SMS During Calls

Our AI sends texts during phone calls based on conversation context. You define scenarios in plain English.

How it works:

1. Write a scenario: "If the caller needs pricing information, text them our rate sheet."
2. The AI understands the context and intent of the conversation.
3. When it recognizes the scenario, it sends the specified text instantly.

Key applications:

1. Appointment Scheduling
   Scenario: "When someone wants to book an appointment, text them our calendar link."
   Action: AI recognizes booking intent and sends link during the call.

2. Document Delivery
   Scenario: "If someone needs product specifications, text the PDF link."
   Action: AI understands the request for specs and texts link in real-time.

3. Promotion Distribution
   Scenario: "When discussing our premium service, text the current promotion code."
   Action: AI detects conversation about premium offerings and sends promo code.

Technical details:

- No coding required. Uses advanced natural language understanding.
- Supports sending text messages with links or information during the call.

Setup process:

1. Access the texting workflows feature in your account
2. Create a new workflow
3. Describe the scenario in plain English
4. Specify the text message to be sent
5. Save and activate the workflow

The system allows for complex scenarios, understanding nuanced conversations. It works for inbound calls, enhancing customer interactions by providing timely information without interrupting the call flow.

This feature leverages AI to automate text message sending based on call content, improving efficiency and customer experience.

# The Speed of Thought

Most people don't realize how much latency matters in conversation. But it does. A lot.

Our AI receptionist is fast. Really fast. We measure its response time in milliseconds. That's quick enough to keep up with natural conversation.

Why does this matter? Because conversation is a dance. A slow partner ruins the rhythm. A fast one keeps you on your toes.

Think about the last time you called a business and got a slow, robotic response. Frustrating, right? That's what we've eliminated.

Our AI doesn't just answer quickly. It thinks quickly. Ask it a complex question, and it doesn't miss a beat. It's like talking to the smartest person you know, but one who never needs to pause to think.

This speed isn't just a neat trick. It's transformative. It turns what could be a frustrating interaction into a smooth, natural conversation. It's the difference between feeling like you're talking to a machine and feeling like you're talking to a hyper-competent human.

And we're not stopping here. We're obsessed with speed. We have a full AI research team dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible. They've made our system faster than anything else on the market. We're constantly tweaking, optimizing, shaving off tiny fractions of time. Because in conversation, every bit of responsiveness counts.

This might seem like overkill. It's not. It's the future of communication. And it's here now, in our AI receptionist.

Try it. Call it. Ask it anything. Then try to remember you're not talking to a human. That's the power of speed.

# Shareable Call Links

Most businesses treat call data like it's radioactive. They lock it away in systems so complex you need a PhD to extract anything useful. We think that's nuts.

We made call sharing as easy as sharing a YouTube video. Here's how it works:

1. You get a link.
2. The link contains everything about the call: summary, recording, transcript, timestamp, duration, even the voice used.
3. You share the link.

That's it. No logins, no special software, no IT department involvement.

Why does this matter?

Because information wants to be free. Not free as in beer, but free as in movement. When you make information easy to share, magical things happen:

1. Sales teams get smarter. That killer pitch your top performer just gave? Now everyone can learn from it.

2. Support gets faster. Tough customer issue? Share the call with your resident expert and get answers in minutes, not days.

3. Product teams get insights. Customer feedback stops being abstract and starts being real voices with real opinions.

4. Training becomes real. Stop telling new hires what good looks like. Show them.

5. Managers can manage. No more "I wish I could have heard that call." Now they can.

But the real power isn't in any one use case. It's in what happens when you remove friction from information flow. Ideas spread. Problems get solved faster. Your entire organization gets smarter.

Think about email. Before it, information moved slowly. After, it zipped around. We're doing the same thing for call data.

Some will worry about security. "What if the wrong person gets the link?" they'll ask. But that's missing the point. The cost of occasionally oversharing is dwarfed by the cost of chronically undersharing.

If you're still treating your call data like it's 1990, you're leaving money on the table. A lot of money. Our shareable call links fix that.

It's a small thing. But small things compound. This small thing could transform how your business operates.

# Set Max Receptionist Minutes

This feature allows you to set a limit on the total number of minutes your AI receptionist can be active within a specified period.

Key features:

1. Customizable limits: Set maximum minutes per day, week, or month.
2. Adjustable thresholds: Easily modify limits as your needs change.
3. Usage tracking: Monitor AI receptionist usage in real-time.
4. Alerts: Receive notifications when approaching or reaching set limits.
5. Overflow options: Define actions to take when limits are reached (e.g., voicemail, call forwarding).

Benefits:

1. Cost control: Manage expenses by capping AI usage.
2. Resource allocation: Ensure AI availability for priority periods.
3. Usage optimization: Identify peak usage times and adjust business processes accordingly.
4. Predictable billing: Avoid unexpected charges from excessive usage.
5. Flexible management: Adapt limits to match seasonal business fluctuations.

Example scenarios:

1. Budget management: Set a monthly limit to align with your customer service budget.
2. Business hours focus: Set higher limits during business hours and lower limits for after-hours.
3. Trial period: Use limited minutes to test the AI receptionist before full implementation.
4. Seasonal adjustment: Increase limits during busy seasons and decrease during slower periods.
5. Department allocation: Assign specific minute allotments to different departments or projects.

The Set Max Receptionist Minutes feature provides you with precise control over your AI receptionist usage, allowing you to balance cost-effectiveness with customer service availability.

# Pronunciation Guides

Most people don't think about pronunciation until it's wrong. But when it is, it's jarring. It's like a sour note in a symphony. That's why we built pronunciation guides into our AI receptionist.

Here's what it does:

1. You tell it how to say things.
2. It learns.
3. It says them right.

Simple, right? But powerful. Here's why:

It makes your AI sound smarter. More human. When it pronounces "Nguyen" correctly, it's not just saying a name. It's showing respect. It's proving it's paying attention.

It's not just about names. It's about your brand. Your products. Your industry's jargon. Get those wrong, and you sound like an outsider. Get them right, and you're one of the tribe.

But here's the real magic: it scales. You teach it once, it gets it right every time. It's like training the perfect employee, except this one never forgets and works 24/7.

Think about what this means. Every call handled perfectly. Every name pronounced right. No more cringing when you hear your company's name mangled.

It's a small thing. But small things compound. They're the difference between good and great. Between a one-time caller and a lifelong customer.

So yes, we built pronunciation guides. Because in business, details matter. And how you say something can be as important as what you're saying.

# The Voice Library: Your Business's Secret Weapon

Voice is the handshake of audio communication. It's the first thing people notice when they call your business, even before they process what's being said.

We've built a voice library with over 100 premium voices for our AI receptionist. That might sound excessive. It's not. Here's why:

1. People are incredibly sensitive to voice, even if they don't consciously realize it. A voice that's slightly off can make a caller hang up before your AI gets to the important stuff.

2. Different businesses need different voices. A local bakery shouldn't sound like a law firm.

3. Sometimes you need to experiment. You might think your flower shop needs a soft, gentle voice, but find that a more energetic one actually engages customers better. With 100+ options, you can try different voices like you'd try different layouts for your store.

We've partnered with top voice providers like ElevenLabs, Deepgram, and Cartesia. These aren't robotic voices from the 90s. They're so natural, most callers won't realize they're talking to an AI.

The variety is staggering. We've got voices across the spectrum of gender identities. Accents ranging from Southern drawl to Scottish brogue. Tones from peppy to professional. Speeds from rapid-fire New Yorker to laid-back surfer. Whatever your business needs, we've probably got it.

You can fine-tune these voices too. Adjust speed, pitch, even emphasis on specific words. It's like having a voice actor you can direct, except this one works 24/7 and never calls in sick.

Here's a tip: use different voices for different situations. Have a more empathetic voice for handling complaints. Use a cheerful voice for promotions. It's a small thing, but it can significantly impact how people perceive your message.

The best part? You're not locked in. If you decide your current voice isn't working, just pick a new one. It takes less time than brewing a pot of coffee and doesn't disrupt your service.

This might seem like a lot of fuss over a voice. But in the world of small business, details often make the difference between a one-time customer and a loyal regular. And when it comes to communicating with your customers, your voice isn't just a detail. It's the audio embodiment of your business.

Small business owners have enough to worry about. Your AI receptionist's voice shouldn't be one of those things. With our voice library, you can find the perfect voice for your business, or even several perfect voices for different situations.

Choose wisely. Your business's voice is saying more than you think.

# Premium AI Models: The Brains Behind Our Digital Receptionist

Remember when AI was as dumb as a rock? Not anymore. Our receptionist is powered by GPT-4, Claude, and Grok - the Einsteins of the AI world, but with better social skills.

These silicon savants:

1. Actually understand context. It's like they've been eavesdropping on humans for years.
2. Talk like real people. No more chatting with dim toasters.
3. Have elephant-grade memory. They won't forget what you said two sentences ago.
4. Learn constantly. It's like they're binge-watching TED talks at warp speed.
5. Speak multiple languages. They might understand your great-aunt better than you do.

The kicker? If you're feeling nerdy, you can swap these models easier than changing a light bulb. It's like hot-swapping brains, minus the mess.

What's in it for you? Happier customers, consistent brand voice, and adaptability that'd make a chameleon jealous. It's like having a super-intelligent, never-tiring clone of yourself. Except better at math. And small talk.

Welcome to the future of customer service. No, you can't marry it. We already asked.

# [Advanced] Post Call Webhooks: Supercharging Your AI Receptionist

Imagine if your AI receptionist could instantly beam every important detail from each call right into your business systems. That's what post-call webhooks do. They're like giving your AI superpowers.

Here's the deal: post-call webhooks let you automatically send call data to your own servers or other services as soon as a call ends. It's for folks who aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves and do a bit of coding.

What can you do with this?

1. Update your CRM in real-time
2. Adjust lead scores instantly
3. Create support tickets automatically
4. Update inventory levels on the fly
5. Feed call data directly into your analytics tools

It's not just clever tech. It's about making your business faster and smarter.

For the tech-savvy, here's what you get:

- Real-time data transmission
- Customizable payload
- Multiple endpoint support
- Secure HTTPS transmission
- Automatic retry for failed deliveries

But let's be clear: this is advanced stuff. If you're not into coding, don't worry. We've got other ways to connect your calls to your apps, like Zapier. It's easier to use and still pretty powerful. And if you prefer to keep things simple, you can always export your call data directly from your dashboard.

The real power of webhooks is in what they enable:

1. Instant updates: No lag between a call ending and your systems knowing about it
2. Custom integrations: Slot call data right into your existing workflows
3. Automation: Trigger actions in other systems based on call outcomes

This is about making your business more responsive and efficient. It's about turning every call into actionable data, instantly.

Whether you're ready to dive into webhooks or prefer our simpler integration options, your AI receptionist is ready to power up your business. The choice is yours.

# Post Call Notifications: Your Business's Sixth Sense

Imagine a world where your business could listen to every customer interaction, extract the crucial information, and instantly alert the right people. Now stop imagining, because that world is here.

Our Post Call Notifications aren't just a feature; they're a superpower for your business. Here's why:

Picture this: It's 3 AM. A customer calls about a critical issue with your product. Your AI handles the call flawlessly, but that's just the beginning. Within seconds of the call ending, your lead engineer receives an email alert. By the time she wakes up, she's already aware of the problem and can start working on a solution. That's not just efficient; it's game-changing.

How does it work? It's deceptively simple:

1. You tell the system what matters to you, in plain English. "If someone mentions a bug and sounds angry, notify the dev team and the customer success lead."

2. Our AI listens to every call, understanding context and emotion, not just keywords.

3. When it spots something important, it fires off an alert faster than any human could.

But here's the real magic: this system learns and adapts. It's not just following rules; it's understanding your business. Over time, it gets smarter, more nuanced, more valuable.

Think about what this means:

- No more missed opportunities because the right person wasn't informed.
- No more customers falling through the cracks.
- No more hoping that important information makes its way to the right team.

This isn't just about being reactive. It's about being predictive. It's about turning every customer interaction into actionable intelligence.

In a world where customer experience is everything, this is your secret weapon. It's like having a brilliant, tireless assistant who never sleeps, never misses a detail, and always knows exactly who needs to know what.

The businesses that win in the coming decades will be the ones that can listen at scale, understand deeply, and act instantly. This tool doesn't just help you do that; it does it for you.

So ask yourself: Can you afford not to have this superpower?

# Pick Your Area Code

Most businesses are stuck with whatever area code they're given. But what if you could choose?

Our service lets you pick your AI receptionist's area code. It's a small thing that can make a big difference.

Here's how it works:

1. We show you available area codes.
2. You pick one.
3. Your AI gets a number with that code.

Simple, right? But powerful. Here's why:

1. You can match your physical location. Or not. Your choice.

2. Want to seem local in a new market? Pick that area code. Instant presence.

3. People like familiar area codes. They're more likely to answer.

4. Expanding? Get multiple numbers with different codes. One AI, many markets.

5. The AI works the same, regardless of the number. All features, all area codes.

This isn't just about phone numbers. It's about perception. It's about strategy.

Think about it. A startup in Iowa could have a Silicon Valley number. A New York firm could seem local in Texas. A solo entrepreneur could look like a national company.

It's a hack, in a way. A legal, effective hack of the phone system and human psychology.

But here's the real point: it lets you control how you appear. In business, perception often becomes reality.

So pick your area code. It's a small choice that could shape your company's future.

# The Phone as a Booking Interface: Revolutionizing Customer Interactions

## Imagine This

Your phone rings. You ignore it, focused on your work. But then you glance at your calendar. A new appointment appears, as if by magic. Then another. And another.

This isn't science fiction. It's what happens when you turn your phone into a booking interface.

## The Problem: Missed Opportunities

Most businesses still treat phone calls as interruptions. They're stuck in the past, letting opportunities slip away with every unanswered ring. Every missed call is a missed opportunity. Every delayed booking is potential revenue lost.

## The Solution: AI-Powered Booking Interface

We've built an AI that doesn't just answer calls; it fills your schedule. It turns your phone line into a direct pipeline to your calendar.

### Key Features:

1. **24/7 Availability**: Imagine your calendar populating itself, round the clock, without you lifting a finger.
2. **Real-Time Booking**: Captures intent at its peak, turning interest into action instantly.
3. **Frictionless Experience**: No hold music, no back-and-forth about available times, no fumbling for pens.
4. **Google Calendar Integration**: Seamlessly syncs with your Google Calendar, ensuring real-time updates and avoiding double bookings.

## The Benefits: Beyond Efficiency

This isn't just about efficiency. It's about:

- Never missing another booking because you were too busy to pick up the phone.
- Combining the efficiency of technology with the warmth of human interaction.
- Being there, ready to serve, at the exact moment of customer interest.

## The Future of Customer Interaction

Imagine a world where every call could instantly become a booking. Where your phone line is a direct pipeline to your calendar. This is more than a feature. It's a revolution in how you interact with your customers.

Think about the last time you tried to book something over the phone. The hold music. The back-and-forth about available times. The fumbling for a pen to write down the details. Now erase all that friction. That's what we're offering.

This is the future of customer interaction - not cold, impersonal online forms, not overworked, inconsistent human receptionists, but an AI that offers the best of both worlds.

## Grow Your Business Automatically

Let your phone fill your calendar. Let it grow your business. While you sleep. While you work. While you live.

The phone is ringing. Are you ready to answer it in a whole new way?

# Non-English Language Support

Most AIs ignore non-English speakers. Big mistake. There's a whole world out there.

Our AI speaks multiple languages. Not just phrases, but fluently. It gets idioms, adjusts for accents, and can even learn your industry's jargon.

Why does this matter?

1. More customers. Obviously.
2. Happier customers. People prefer their own language.
3. You look good. Multilingual service is rare and impressive.
4. Consistency. Same quality, any language.

Think about it. A Japanese tourist calls your hotel. A Spanish-speaking patient needs emergency care. A German company wants to do business. You're ready for all of them.

This isn't just a feature. It's a superpower. In a global world, speaking one language is like having one arm. Why limit yourself?

Break down language barriers. Serve everyone. Grow.

# Minutes Included: Free for Most, Fair for All

Here's the deal: we give you 200+ minutes free each month. That's about 170-250 calls, enough for most small to medium-sized businesses to never pay extra. Why? Because that's how it should be.

Our competitors? They nickel-and-dime you for every second. We don't. We looked at what most businesses use and said, "That's free." Only if you go over do you pay, and even then, it's cheap. Really cheap.

It's simple:

- You get 200+ free minutes monthly. Use them however you want.
- Our AI is efficient. It handles most calls in a couple of minutes.
- Go over? No sweat. Extra minutes cost peanuts, with a small fee based on the voice you choose. Typically, it's a few cents per minute. Depending on the voice you've chosen.

But here's the kicker: total transparency. Log into your portal, and boom - there's your usage, your billing, everything. No surprises, no hidden fees. Just clear, honest numbers.

We're not trying to make money on minutes. We're trying to build something great. Something that helps businesses grow. If you grow, we grow. That's alignment.

So yeah, "minutes included" isn't just a feature. It's a philosophy. It's us saying, "We're in this together." And that's how you build something that lasts.

Remember, 250 minutes is typically enough for most SMBs. If you're a high-volume user, you might see some overage charges, but they're usually negligible compared to your monthly fee.

# Link Tracking: The Hidden Pulse of Your Business

Most businesses are flying blind. They send out messages, hoping someone will read them. But hope is not a strategy.

What if you could see exactly who engages with your messages? Not just guesses, but hard data. That's what link tracking does. It's like x-ray vision for your communication.

Here's how it works:

1. Click-through Rates
   You send a link. We tell you who clicked it, when, and how often. It's that simple.

2. Link Performance Analysis
   Some links work better than others. We show you which ones. It's like A/B testing, but for your entire communication strategy.

3. Individual Recipient Tracking
   Know who's interested. Not just demographics, but actual names. It's the difference between fishing with a net and fishing with a spear.

4. CRM Integration
   Your CRM isn't just a database. It's a living, breathing representation of your business relationships. We keep it up-to-date, automatically.

This isn't just a feature. It's a fundamental shift in how you understand your business. It's the difference between thinking you know what's happening and actually knowing.

Most businesses are still in the dark ages of communication. They're shouting into the void, hoping someone will answer. With link tracking, you're not shouting. You're having a conversation. A data-driven, insightful conversation.

This is how you build a business that's not just successful, but understood. Because in the end, understanding is power. And power is growth.

# Intake Form Workflows: Automated Information Gathering

Our AI collects specific information from callers at the start of a call or when certain topics arise. Set up using plain English instructions.

How it works:

1. Write a scenario: "At the start of each call, ask for the caller's name and account number."
2. The AI follows your instructions to gather the specified information.
3. Collected data is stored separately for easy access and use.

Key applications:

1. Customer Identification
   Scenario: "Ask for the caller's full name and date of birth at the beginning of each call."
   Action: AI collects this information before proceeding with the main conversation.

2. Appointment Scheduling
   Scenario: "When someone wants to book an appointment, ask for their preferred date, time, and service type."
   Action: AI gathers necessary details for scheduling when the topic arises.

3. Support Ticket Creation
   Scenario: "If a caller reports a technical issue, ask for their device type, operating system, and problem description."
   Action: AI collects specific details about the technical problem during the conversation.

Technical details:

- No coding required. Uses natural language processing to understand instructions and caller responses.
- Supports both mandatory initial questions and context-triggered information gathering.

Setup process:

1. Access the intake form workflows feature
2. Create a new workflow
3. Specify when to ask questions (start of call or upon certain topics)
4. List the questions to ask in plain English
5. Save and activate the workflow

Data Management and Export:

- View all intake form responses in a dedicated dashboard section.
- Filter and sort responses based on date, specific questions, or other criteria.
- Export data in CSV or Excel formats for further analysis.
- Zapier Integration: Connect intake form data to other apps, enabling automatic updates to CRMs, project management tools, or databases.

This feature ensures consistent data collection across calls and integrates smoothly with existing business workflows.

# Extension Digits: Old-School Simplicity Meets AI Smarts

Let's start with what extension digits are: they're those short numbers you dial to reach a specific person or department in a company. Like "dial 2 for sales." It's a feature as old as business phone systems themselves.

Now, you might wonder why we'd add such an old-school feature to our AI receptionist. It's simple: because it works. And when something works, smart people keep it around.

Here's how we've implemented extension digits:

1. Speed. If you know the extension, just dial it after the greeting. The AI steps aside, and you get where you're going fast.

2. Flexibility. Don't know the extension? No worries. The AI can help, or you can enter it anytime during the call.

3. User choice. Speak the extension or use the keypad. We're not picky.

4. Smart directory. Lost? Ask the AI. It'll guide you to the right extension.

5. Easy management. Add or change extensions through a simple dashboard. No need to call IT.

Why does this matter? A few reasons:

1. Efficiency. The right person gets the call, quickly.

2. Time-saving. Known destination? Bypass the AI chitchat.

3. Familiarity. For those who prefer traditional systems, this feels comfortable.

4. Scalability. As your business grows, your phone system adapts.

5. Integration. Works with your current internal numbers if you want.

Here's how it might play out:

- A caller hits 2 immediately and reaches sales. No waiting, no explaining.
- Someone needs tech support mid-call. The AI offers the extension, caller uses it.
- A person asks for Jane in accounting. AI provides Jane's extension and offers to connect.
- 3 AM emergency? A special after-hours extension ensures the call gets through.
- Multi-city business? Extensions can route calls to the right location.

This feature is like a bridge. On one side, there's the AI future. On the other, the familiar past. It's as efficient as an AI, but as simple as an old phone system. It's the best of both worlds.

And that's the key. We're not just building a smarter phone system. We're building one that works better for everyone - tech-savvy or tech-wary, in a hurry or happy to chat. Because truly great technology isn't just clever. It's useful.

By combining AI smarts with the tried-and-true extension system, we're not replacing the old way. We're enhancing it. It's like adding a turbo engine to a reliable old car. Same familiar drive, but now with extra power when you need it.

# Autopilot CRM: Your AI Receptionist's Secret Weapon

Imagine if your receptionist not only answered calls but also organized your entire business. That's what our AI does, but without the coffee breaks or awkward water cooler conversations.

Here's the deal:

1. Your AI receptionist takes calls. That's a given.
2. But here's the magic: it's secretly building your CRM while it chats.
3. You wake up to a beautifully organized lead database. It's like elves came in the night, but instead of making shoes, they sorted your contacts.

Let's break it down:

1. Group Builder (or "How to Teach AI to Read Minds")

   - You create custom groups: "Hot Leads", "Tire Kickers", "People Who Might Actually Pay Us".
   - You tell the AI what to listen for: "If they ask about pricing three times in five minutes, they're a 'Tire Kicker'."
   - The AI nods politely (metaphorically) and gets to work.

2. Automatic Lead Sorting (because manually organizing leads is so 2005)

   - While your AI is chatting about your services, it's categorizing leads faster than you can say "Where did I put that business card?"
   - It drops leads into your custom groups based on the conversation. "Hot Leads" get VIP treatment, "Tire Kickers" get a polite newsletter.

3. Note-taking (because your memory isn't as good as you think it is)

   - The AI jots down key points from each call. "Loves cats, hates Mondays, might buy if we throw in a free toaster."
   - You can add your own notes too. "Sounded like George Clooney. Investigate Hollywood connection?"

4. Lead Shuffling (for when you change your mind)

   - Drag and drop leads between groups. It's like Tinder, but for your business contacts.
   - "This 'Tire Kicker' actually bought something. Promote to 'Actually Paid Us'!"

5. Custom Follow-ups (because one size doesn't fit all)

   - Set up automated follow-ups for each group. "Hot Leads" get a call tomorrow, "Tire Kickers" get an email next week.
   - The AI handles it all. You just sit back and watch the sales roll in. Or trickle in. We're AI, not magicians.

6. Views for Days (because one size doesn't fit all)
   - Board View: For when you want to feel like a startup guru.
   - List View: For when you need to impress the board with hard numbers.
   - Individual View: For deep dives into each lead's psyche. Or just their contact info.

Setting it up is easier than explaining to your parents why you're still single:

1. Log in to your dashboard. You can do this. We believe in you.
2. Create some groups. Get creative. "People Who Might Actually Buy Something" is a personal favorite.
3. Tell your AI receptionist what to listen for. It's like training a puppy, but this one actually listens.
4. Set up your follow-up preferences. The AI will handle the rest.
5. Sit back and watch. Your AI receptionist is now a lean, mean, CRM-building machine.

Here's the best part: while you're sleeping, binge-watching, or "working from home" (we won't tell), your AI receptionist is building your CRM empire. It's answering calls, categorizing leads, taking notes, and setting up follow-ups faster than you can say "I should really update our database."

This isn't just a feature. It's like having a super-intelligent octopus manning your phones, organizing your leads, and probably plotting world domination on the side. But don't worry about that last part.

So, you can stick with your current system of scribbled notes and "I'll remember that name" promises, or you can join us in the future. Where the AIs do the grunt work, and you can focus on what you do best: convincing yourself that this time, the gym membership will definitely get used.

# Phone and Texting Features: Your AI Receptionist's Swiss Army Knife

Your receptionist is more than just a phone number. But the phone number is the first thing people see. That's why we've made it easy for you to keep your old number, get a new one, choose an area code, and even get a texting bot.

## Keep Your Old Number (Because Change is Scary)

You know that phone number you've had since the Stone Age? Keep it:

- Just forward your calls to our AI. It's like call forwarding, but the person on the other end is smarter.
- Your customers won't notice a thing. Except maybe that your "receptionist" suddenly got a lot more efficient.
- It's like giving your old number a brain transplant. Same body, new superhuman abilities.
- Even your grandma could set this up. Seriously, call her and ask.

## Get a Shiny New Number (For the Cool Kids)

Want to start fresh? We've got numbers. Lots of numbers:

- Fully loaded with AI goodness right out of the box. It's like getting a new iPhone, but useful.
- Use it as your main line or your secret "smart" line. We won't tell.
- Perfect for new businesses or for when you want to pretend you're starting a new business.
- Every call to this number gets the AI treatment. It's like having a bouncer, but for phone calls.

## Choose Your Area Code (Expand Your Reach)

Need a presence in multiple locations? We've got you covered:

- Select from a wide range of area codes to establish a local presence.
- Expand your business reach across different regions.
- Connect with customers in various markets efficiently.
- Our AI provides consistent, high-quality service regardless of the area code.

## AI Texting Bot & Platform (Because Talking is So Last Century)

For when your fingers need to do the talking:

- Our AI handles texts like a champ. It's like having a really smart pen pal.
- It remembers your conversations. Unlike your spouse.
- You can jump in anytime. It's like AI with training wheels.
- Works seamlessly with phone calls. It's the communication equivalent of a mullet - business in the front, party in the back.
- Available 24/7. Because sleep is for the weak.
- Uses the same number for calls and texts. We're not trying to confuse you here.

## How This All Works Together (Like a Well-Oiled Machine, But Without the Oil)

1. Pick a Number: Your old one or a new one. It's like choosing between your comfy old shoes or those shiny new ones.
2. Add AI Magic: We sprinkle our AI fairy dust on your chosen number.
3. Sit Back and Relax: Watch as your AI handles calls and texts like a boss. It's like having a super-efficient clone of yourself, but without the ethical dilemmas.

By combining these features, you're basically creating a communication Voltron. It's powerful, it's efficient, and it never complains about working overtime. Whether you're a startup in a garage or a Fortune 500 (in which case, why are you still in a garage?), our system flexes to fit your needs. Welcome to the future of communication. No, you can't date it.

# The Notification System That Thinks

Most notification systems are dumb. They blast everyone with everything. Ours is different. It's like having a really smart assistant who knows exactly what information each person on your team needs, and when they need it.

Here's what makes it special:

1. It summarizes calls like a pro journalist.
   After each call, it sends out a report that's clear, concise, and complete. It's not just a transcript - it's the story of what happened, why it matters, and what needs to happen next.

2. It watches your workflows like a hawk.
   When something important happens in your business processes, it lets the right people know immediately. It's like having someone constantly monitoring your operations, but without the salary. Your grandma could set this up.

3. It understands context, unlike your mother in law.
   You can teach it to recognize specific situations in plain English. For example: "If someone's talking about a refund for more than 10 minutes, tell Sarah." It's like giving your notifications a brain.

4. It's as flexible as a yoga instructor.
   You can mix and match notification types, add or remove people, and change the rules whenever you want. It grows and changes with your business.

5. It uses email, because email works.
   We don't try to force you into some new app or platform. Email is universal, searchable, and doesn't disappear after 24 hours like some chat messages.

Setting it up is dead simple:

1. Tell it what you care about.
2. Tell it who should know.
3. If you want, tell it some specific scenarios to watch for.
4. Let it do its thing.

The result? Your team always knows what's going on, without drowning in useless notifications. It's like giving everyone a sixth sense for your business.

This isn't just a feature. It's like hiring a team of really smart assistants who never sleep, never miss anything, and always make sure the right information gets to the right people at the right time. And they do it all automatically, even when your AI is handling the calls.

In a world where information overload is the norm, this is how you stay on top of things without going crazy.

# Call Transferring Workflows: Real-Time Intelligent Call Routing

Imagine a receptionist who not only understands every nuance of a conversation but can instantly connect callers to the right person. That's what our AI does, but better.

During calls, our AI listens and thinks. It's not just pattern matching; it's understanding context and intent in real-time. You teach it using plain English, like you'd explain to a smart human assistant.

Here's the magic:

1. You write a scenario: "If someone sounds frustrated about a charge they don't recognize, transfer to billing."
2. As the call unfolds, the AI is constantly analyzing. It's not just listening for keywords, but understanding the caller's emotions and the conversation's subtext.
3. The moment it detects a match - not just the words, but the situation you described - it smoothly hands off the call.

This isn't just about efficiency. It's about creating the kind of experience that turns customers into fans. Consider these real-world applications:

1. The Frustrated Customer
   Scenario: "When a caller's tone becomes agitated and they mention 'wrong charge' or 'billing error', transfer to our senior account specialists."
   In action: The AI picks up on rising tension, recognizes the billing context, and routes the call to someone equipped to handle both the technical and emotional aspects of the situation.

2. The Technical Puzzle
   Scenario: "If a caller describes a product issue using technical jargon or mentions trying multiple troubleshooting steps, transfer to tier 2 support."
   In action: The AI distinguishes between basic and complex queries, ensuring that sophisticated problems reach your most skilled technicians immediately.

3. The Hot Lead
   Scenario: "When someone asks detailed questions about product capabilities or mentions a competitor, transfer to our senior sales team."
   In action: The AI identifies high-potential sales opportunities in real-time, connecting promising leads directly to your closers.

The beauty is in the simplicity. You don't need to be a coder or an AI expert. You just need to understand your business and your customers. The system does the heavy lifting, using advanced natural language processing to turn your instructions into sophisticated decision-making algorithms.

Setting it up is straightforward:

1. Open the call transferring workflows section
2. Create a new workflow
3. Describe the scenario as you would to a clever colleague
4. Tell it where to send the call when the scenario occurs
5. Activate it and watch it go to work

This isn't just a feature. It's like giving every caller a personal concierge who instantly understands their needs and connects them to the right expert. In a world where customer experience is everything, this is how you stand out.

# Call Recordings: Your AI's Memory Bank

Most businesses don't record calls. They're missing out on a goldmine of information. Our system records all AI-handled calls by default. This isn't just a feature - it's a superpower for your business.

Here's what you get:

1. A time machine for conversations. Replay any call, anytime. It's like being able to go back and listen to every customer interaction you've ever had.

2. Fort Knox for audio. Your calls are locked down tighter than a drum. Only the people you choose can access them.

3. Playback that doesn't suck. No fumbling with clunky software. Our audio player is so simple, your grandma could use it.

4. Find needles in haystacks. Want that call from last Tuesday about a refund? Our search is so good, it's like having a personal assistant with perfect memory.

5. Take your calls to go. Download recordings faster than you can say "export". Perfect for when you need to share or backup.

6. Share with a click. Generate shareable links to send recordings to team members or stakeholders. No more lengthy email attachments or complicated file transfers.

Why this matters:

1. Catch mistakes before they snowball. Regular reviews keep your AI sharp and your customers happy.

2. Turn good into great. Use real calls to level up your AI. It's like giving it a cheat code for customer service.

3. Cover your ass. When someone says "But your AI promised...", you've got proof.

4. Stay legal. Some industries require call recording. We've got you covered.

5. Customer whisperer. Analyze calls to read your customers' minds (almost).

Real-world magic:

1. Weekly AI report card. Grade your AI's performance across hundreds of calls in minutes.

2. Defuse customer bombs. When a complaint comes in, rewind and see where things went sideways.

3. Clone your best sales calls. Find out why some calls convert better and teach your AI the secret sauce.

4. CYA in style. In industries where talk is legally binding, your call log is better than a contract.

This isn't just a feature. It's like giving your business a photographic memory. You'll wonder how you ever managed without it. And with shareable links, you can easily collaborate and get insights from your entire team. Welcome to the future of customer interaction.

# Auto Hangup Feature

Our AI receptionist can automatically end calls when the conversation naturally concludes.

Key aspects:

1. Analyzes conversation flow to detect when topics are addressed
2. Recognizes end-of-call cues
3. Concludes with polite closing remarks
4. Can be disabled based on company policy

The Auto Hangup feature enhances efficiency while maintaining quality customer interactions, mimicking a skilled human receptionist.

# API Workflows: Real-Time Data Integration

Our AI can interact with external APIs during calls, fetching or sending data based on conversation context. Set up API interactions using plain English instructions.

How it works:

1. Write a scenario: "If someone asks about their order status, check our shipping API."
2. The AI understands the context and intent of the conversation.
3. When it recognizes the scenario, it makes the API call and uses the data in the conversation.

Key applications:

1. Order Status Checks
   Scenario: "When a caller asks about their order, fetch status from our shipping API."
   Action: AI retrieves real-time order information and relays it to the caller.

2. Inventory Queries
   Scenario: "If someone asks if a product is in stock, check our inventory API."
   Action: AI gets current inventory data and informs the caller about availability.

3. Customer Information Updates
   Scenario: "When a caller provides a new address, update it in our customer database API."
   Action: AI sends the new information to update the customer record in real-time.

Technical details:
- No coding required for scenario setup. (API endpoints must be configured separately)
- Supports GET and POST requests to predefined API endpoints.
- Can use information from the call (like customer ID) in API requests.

Setup process:
1. Access the API workflows feature
2. Create a new workflow
3. Describe the API interaction scenario in plain English
4. Select the relevant API endpoint and specify how to use the data
5. Save and activate the workflow

This feature allows for dynamic, data-driven conversations, enhancing the AI's ability to provide accurate, real-time information to callers.
